# odin-recipes

*This is a simple recipe website built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course.*
*The goal of this project is to practice foundational HTML and CSS skills by creating a static webpage that displays a collection of recipes.*
*Each recipe includes an image, a description, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.*

## Demo
